# Simple Q&A Chatbot with Ollama (Streamlit App)

## üìñ Project Description
The **Simple Q&A Chatbot** is a conversational AI application built with **Streamlit** and **LangChain**. It leverages **Ollama** to utilize open-source language models like `gemma:2b` for answering user queries in real-time. The app provides an easy-to-use interface with options to adjust the response creativity and token limits. With **Langsmith** integration, users can track and analyze chatbot interactions for better performance insights.

This project serves as a lightweight and flexible solution for information retrieval, educational purposes, and rapid prototyping of conversational AI systems.

## üöÄ How to Run the Application

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or later
- `pip` (Python package manager)

## üîë How to Get Your OpenAI API Key
1. Go to the [OpenAI website](https://openai.com).
2. Sign up for an account or log in if you already have one.
3. Navigate to your **API Keys** section by clicking on your profile icon and selecting **API Keys**.
4. Click on **Create new secret key**.
5. Copy the generated API key. This key will be used in your `.env` file as `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Keep your API key secure and do not share it publicly. Never hard-code it into your scripts. Always use environment variables to manage it.
